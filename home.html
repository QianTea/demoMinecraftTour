	                Minecraft is a sandbox game, in which your avatar wanders around in a world, collecting resources and using items. You need to master the control system; if you are having trouble with it, you may want to start with a Peaceful Mode world to practice.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	            	In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                Your world is made of blocks, mostly cubical. These blocks represent objects, but their size also makes a standard measure of distance; this and many other pages talk in terms of, e.g., "five blocks away" (officially, each block is a one-meter cube). Your character can stand within a single block's space, and it stands a little less than two blocks tall.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                 Time passes within this world; a game day passes in 20 real-world minutes. Nighttime is much more dangerous than daytime; the game starts at dawn, and you have 10 minutes of game time before nightfall. The primary purpose of this guide is to let you "find your feet" and get basic equipment and shelter before night comes.
